"Empty your mind. Be formless, shapeless - like water. You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend!" -- Bruce Lee.

Flexibility and adaptation are the key.
